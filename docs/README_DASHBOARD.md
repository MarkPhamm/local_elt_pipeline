# CFPB Analytics Dashboard (Streamlit)

The primary BI layer for this project is **[dbt Charts](README_DBT_CHARTS.md)** (`duckdb_dbt/charts/`, `uv run dct serve --project-dir duckdb_dbt`). This page documents the optional Streamlit app in `app/dashboard/`.

**A local Streamlit dashboard for exploring Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) complaint data: trends, company performance, and product friction points.**

---

## 📖 Dashboard Overview

This dashboard serves as the front-end layer for the CFPB ELT pipeline. It is designed to help analysts and stakeholders answer key questions:
* **Macro Trends:** How is complaint volume changing over time?
* **Company Benchmarking:** Which companies handle complaints most effectively?
* **Root Cause Analysis:** What specific products or issues are causing consumer friction?
* **Geographic Distribution:** Where are complaints originating from?

### Architecture Highlights

**✨ Refactored for Maintainability:**
- **DRY Principles:** All chart configurations, UI components, and data transformations are centralized
- **Separation of Concerns:** Each module has a single, clear responsibility
- **Reusable Components:** 11 chart methods, 6 UI components, 6 data transformations
- **Single Point of Change:** Update theme colors, fonts, or chart styles in one place

**Key Modules:**
- `config.py` - Theme colors, font settings, color scales
- `chart_factory.py` - Factory methods for consistent Plotly charts
- `components.py` - Reusable KPI cards, filters, containers
- `data_utils.py` - Common pandas operations (aggregations, filtering)
- `utils.py` - Database loading, sidebar filters, global styling

### 2. Executive Summary (`1_executive_summary.py`)
A high-level view for decision-makers to monitor overall system health.

**Key Metrics (KPIs):**
- **Total Volume:** Overall complaint count with thousands separator
- **Timely Response:** Percentage with color-coded indicator (green >90%, yellow ≤90%)
- **Top Product:** Most complained-about product with adaptive text sizing
- **Top Issue:** Most common issue with adaptive text sizing

**Visualizations:**
- **Volume Trends:** Time-series area chart showing complaint spikes over time with monthly resampling
- **Resolution Types:** Donut chart showing company response distribution (e.g., "Closed with explanation")

**Technical Details:**
- Uses `ChartFactory.create_area_chart()` for trend visualization
- Uses `ChartFactory.create_donut_chart()` with center text annotation
- Responsive 2:1 column layout for optimal space utilization

### 3. Company Performance (`2_company_performance.py`)
A benchmarking tool to compare financial institutions against one another.

**Key Components:**
- **Performance Matrix:** Scatter plot analyzing Volume vs. Timeliness relationship
  - X-axis: Total complaint volume
  - Y-axis: Timely response rate (%)
  - Bubble size: Proportional to complaint volume
  - Color: Gradient from red (low timeliness) to blue (high timeliness)
  - Reference lines: Average volume and average timeliness for quadrant analysis

- **Leaderboard:** Top 10 companies ranked by complaint volume
  - Gradient coloring: Green (high timeliness), Red (low timeliness)
  - Blue gradient for volume intensity

**Insights Enabled:**
- Identify high-volume efficient companies (top-right quadrant)
- Flag overwhelmed institutions (high volume, low timeliness)
- Benchmark against industry averages

**Technical Details:**
- Uses `DataTransformations.calculate_company_stats()` for metrics
- Uses `ChartFactory.create_scatter_chart()` with reference lines
- Styled dataframe with dual gradient coloring (RdYlGn + Blues)

### 4. Product Friction Points (`3_product_issues.py`)
A deep-dive tool for Product Managers to identify root causes.

**Key Features:**
- **Complaint Architecture (Treemap):** Hierarchical visualization of Product → Sub-Product
  - Color intensity: Complaint volume
  - Filterable: All Products / Top 5 / Top 3
  - Rounded corners with subtle borders
  
- **Root Cause Investigation:** Drill-down analysis
  - Product selector with info box guidance
  - Top 10 issues for selected product
  - Horizontal bar chart sorted by frequency

**Use Cases:**
- Prioritize product improvements based on complaint volume
